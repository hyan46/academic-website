abstract: Acoustic emission (AE) signals have been widely employed for tracking material
  properties and structural characteristics. In this study, we aim to analyze the
  AE signals gathered during a scanning probe lithography process to classify the
  known microstructure types and discover unknown surface microstructures/anomalies.
  To achieve this, we developed a Hidden Markov Model to consider the temporal dependency
  of the high-resolution AE data. Furthermore, we compute the posterior classification
  probability and the negative likelihood score for microstructure classification
  and discovery. Subsequently, we present a diagnostic procedure to identify the dominant
  AE frequencies that allow us to track the microstructural characteristics. Finally,
  we apply the proposed approach to identify the surface microstructures of additively
  manufactured Ti-6Al-4V and show that it not only achieved a high classification
  accuracy (e.g., more than 90%) but also correctly identified the microstructural
  anomalies that may be subjected further investigation to discover new material phases/properties.
