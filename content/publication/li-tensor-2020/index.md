abstract: Low-rank tensor decomposition and completion have attracted significant
  interest from academia given the ubiquity of tensor data. However, the low-rank
  structure is a global property, which will not be fulfilled when the data presents
  complex and weak dependencies given specific graph structures. One particular application
  that motivates this study is the spatiotemporal data analysis. As shown in the preliminary
  study, weakly dependencies can worsen the low-rank tensor completion performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition
  and completion framework by introducing the $L_1$-norm penalty and Graph Laplacian
  penalty to model the weakly dependency on graph. We further propose an efficient
  optimization algorithm based on the Block Coordinate Descent for efficient estimation.
  A case study based on the metro passenger flow data in Hong Kong is conducted to
  demonstrate improved performance over the regular tensor completion methods.
