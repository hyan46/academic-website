abstract: Multivariate functional data from a complex system are naturally high-dimensional
  and have complex cross-correlation structure. The complexity of data structure can
  be observed as that (1) some functions are strongly correlated with similar features,
  while some others may have almost no cross-correlations with quite diverse features;
  and (2) the cross-correlation structure may also change over time due to the system
  evolution. With this regard, this paper presents a dynamic subspace learning method
  for multivariate functional data modeling. In particular, we consider different
  functions come from different subspaces, and only functions of the same subspace
  have cross-correlations with each other. The subspaces can be automatically formulated
  and learned by reformatting the problem as a sparse regression. By allowing but
  regularizing the regression change over time, we can describe the cross-correlation
  dynamics. The model can be efficiently estimated by the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding
  algorithm (FISTA), and the features of every subspace can be extracted using the
  smooth multi-channel functional PCA. Numerical studies together with case studies
  demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology.
