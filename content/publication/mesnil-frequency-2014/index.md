abstract: Guided wavefield detection is at the basis of a number of promising techniques
  for the identification and the characterization of damage in plate structures. Among
  the processing techniques proposed, the estimation of instantaneous wavenumbers
  can be used as an effective metric that localize and quantifies delaminations in
  composite plates. A process able to estimate the in-plane and out-of-plane (depth)
  coordinate of a feature in a 2D structure using the Frequency Domain Instantaneous
  Wavenumber (FDIW) damage quan-tification technique is detailed in this paper. A
  post processing algorithm using a smooth sparse decomposition is used to highlight
  the studied features. The effectiveness of this method combined to the post processing
  technique is demonstrated for both numerical and experimental cases. This proposed
  methodology can be considered as a first step towards a hybrid structural health
  monitoring/ nondestructive evaluation (SHM/NDE) approach for damage assessment in
  composites.
