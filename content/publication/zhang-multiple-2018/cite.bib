 abstract = {Generally, in an advanced manufacturing system hundreds of sensors are deployed to measure key process variables in real time. Thus it is desirable to develop methodologies to use real-time sensor data for on-line system condition monitoring and anomaly detection. However, there are several challenges in developing an effective process monitoring system: (i) data streams generated by multiple sensors are high-dimensional profiles; (ii) sensor signals are affected by noise due to system-inherent variations; (iii) signals of different sensors have cluster-wise features; and (iv) an anomaly may cause only sparse changes of sensor signals. To address these challenges, this article presents a real-time multiple profiles sensor-based process monitoring system, which includes the following modules: (i) preprocessing sensor signals to remove inherent variations and conduct profile alignments, (ii) using multichannel functional principal component analysis (MFPCA)â€“ based methods to extract sensor features by considering cluster-wise between-sensor correlations, and (iii) constructing a monitoring scheme with the top-R strategy based on the extracted features, which has scalable detection power for different fault patterns. Finally, we implement and demonstrate the proposed framework using data from a real manufacturing system.},
