abstract: 'Generally, in an advanced manufacturing system hundreds of sensors are
  deployed to measure key process variables in real time. Thus it is desirable to
  develop methodologies to use real-time sensor data for on-line system condition
  monitoring and anomaly detection. However, there are several challenges in developing
  an effective process monitoring system: (i) data streams generated by multiple sensors
  are high-dimensional profiles; (ii) sensor signals are affected by noise due to
  system-inherent variations; (iii) signals of different sensors have cluster-wise
  features; and (iv) an anomaly may cause only sparse changes of sensor signals. To
  address these challenges, this article presents a real-time multiple profiles sensor-based
  process monitoring system, which includes the following modules: (i) preprocessing
  sensor signals to remove inherent variations and conduct profile alignments, (ii)
  using multichannel functional principal component analysis (MFPCA)â€“ based methods
  to extract sensor features by considering cluster-wise between-sensor correlations,
  and (iii) constructing a monitoring scheme with the top-R strategy based on the
  extracted features, which has scalable detection power for different fault patterns.
  Finally, we implement and demonstrate the proposed framework using data from a real
  manufacturing system.'
