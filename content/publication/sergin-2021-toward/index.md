abstract: Variational autoencoders have been recently proposed for the problem of
  process monitoring. While these works show impressive results over classical methods,
  the proposed monitoring statistics often ignore the inconsistencies in learned lower-dimensional
  representations and computational limitations in high-dimensional approximations.
  In this work, we first manifest these issues and then overcome them with a novel
  statistic formulation that increases out-of-control detection accuracy without compromising
  computational efficiency. We demonstrate our results on a simulation study with
  explicit control over latent variations, and a real-life example of image profiles
  obtained from a hot steel rolling process.
