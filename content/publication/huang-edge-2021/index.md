abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for training and deploying deep
  neural networks on the edge computing framework for image defect detection and classification.
  In the proposed framework, we combine the transfer learning and data augmentation
  with the improved accuracy given the small sample size. We further implement the
  edge computing framework to satisfy the real-time computational requirement. After
  the implement of the proposed model into a rolling manufacturing system, we conclude
  that deep learning approaches can perform around 30â€“ 40% better than some traditional
  machine learning algorithms such as random forest, decision tree, and SVM in terms
  of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by deploying the CNNs in the edge computing
  framework, we can significantly reduce the computational time and satisfy the real-time
  computational requirement in the high-speed rolling and inspection system. Finally,
  the saliency map and embedding layer visualization techniques are used for a better
  understanding of proposed deep learning models.
