abstract: As the use of and dependence on composite materials is increasing in all
  industries, there is a strong need for reliable, accurate, and fast techniques for
  damage detection and quantification in composite plate-like structures. Among the
  various nondestructive evaluation and structural health monitoring techniques, many
  rely on Lamb wave long-range propagation. A wavenumber quantification technique
  called frequency domain instantaneous wavenumber has been previously proven to be
  an efficient technique to estimate in-plane (i.e. position) and out-of-plane (i.e.
  depth) coordinates of defects in composites. This paper further develops this technique
  by (1) reducing the acquisition time by one order of magnitude while improving the
  quality of detection, (2) implementing an automatic feature extraction process to
  automatically assess the geometry and obtain information which can be directly used
  for decision making, and (3) quantifying the cumulative error of the whole process.
