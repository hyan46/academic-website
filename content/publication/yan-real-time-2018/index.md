abstract: High-dimensional data monitoring and diagnosis has recently attracted increasing
  attention among researchers as well as practitioners. However, existing process
  monitoring methods fail to fully use the information of high-dimensional data streams
  due to their complex characteristics including the large dimensionality, spatio-temporal
  correlation structure, and nonstationarity. In this article, we propose a novel
  process monitoring methodology for high-dimensional data streams including profiles
  and images that can effectively address foregoing challenges. We introduce spatio-temporal
  smooth sparse decomposition (ST-SSD), which serves as a dimension reduction and
  denoising technique by decomposing the original tensor into the functional mean,
  sparse anomalies, and random noises. ST-SSD is followed by a sequential likelihood
  ratio test on extracted anomalies for process monitoring. To enable real-time implementation
  of the proposed methodology, recursive estimation procedures for ST-SSD are developed.
  ST-SSD also provides useful diagnostics information about the location of change
  in the functional mean. The proposed methodology is validated through various simulations
  and real case studies. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.
