abstract: Advanced 3D metrology technologies such as coordinate measuring machine
  and laser 3D scanners have facilitated the collection of massive point cloud data,
  beneficial for process monitoring, control and optimization. However, due to their
  high dimensionality and structure complexity, modeling and analysis of point clouds
  are still a challenge. In this article, we use multilinear algebra techniques and
  propose a set of tensor regression approaches to model the variational patterns
  of point clouds and to link them to process variables. The performance of the proposed
  methods is evaluated through simulations and a real case study of turning process
  optimization.
