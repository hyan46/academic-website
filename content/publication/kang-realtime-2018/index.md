abstract: Ahstract- Machine degradation has significant impact on the production system
  performance. Its variation might lead to large deviation from the steady state performance
  of the whole system. In this work, we build up a model to estimate the long-term
  production performance of the two-machine-and-one-buffer production systems, given
  the real-time machine degradation signals. A phase-type distribution is generated
  to mimic the remaining life distribution of each machine given the degradation signal.
  Then a continuous Markovian model is formulated to predict longterm system throughput
  rate for a two-machine-and-one-buffer system. With the fluctuation of machine degradation
  signals, such a model can effectively estimate the expected system performance in
  real-time.
