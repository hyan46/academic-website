abstract: Image-based process monitoring has recently attracted increasing attention
  due to the advancement of the sensing technologies. However, existing process monitoring
  methods fail to fully utilize the spatial information of images due to their complex
  characteristics including the high-dimensionality and complex spatial structures.
  Recent advancements in unsupervised deep models such as generative adversarial networks
  (GAN) and adversarial autoencoders (AAE) has enabled to learn the complex spatial
  structures automatically. Inspired by this advancement, we propose an anomaly detection
  framework based on the AAE for unsupervised anomaly detection for images. AAE combines
  the power of GAN with the variational autoencoder, which serves as a nonlinear dimension
  reduction technique. Based on this, we propose a monitoring statistic efficiently
  capturing the change of the data. The performance of the proposed AAE-based anomaly
  detection algorithm is validated through a simulation study and real case study
  for rolling defect detection.
