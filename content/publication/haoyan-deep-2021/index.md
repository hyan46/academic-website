abstract: In multistage manufacturing systems, modeling multiple quality indices based
  on the process sensing variables is important. However, the classic modeling technique
  predicts each quality variable one at a time, which fails to consider the correlation
  within or between stages. We propose a deep multistage multi-task learning framework
  to jointly predict all output sensing variables in a unified end-to-end learning
  framework according to the sequential system architecture in the MMS. Our numerical
  studies and real case study have shown that the new model has a superior performance
  compared to many benchmark methods as well as great interpretability through developed
  variable selection techniques.
