abstract: In this paper, we propose a class of monitoring statistics for a mean shift
  in a sequence of high-dimensional observations. Inspired by the recent U-statistic
  based retrospective tests developed by Wang et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2020),
  we advance the U-statistic based approach to the sequential monitoring problem by
  developing a new adaptive monitoring procedure that can detect both dense and sparse
  changes in real time. Unlike Wang et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2020), where self-normalization
  was used in their tests, we instead introduce a class of estimators for q-norm of
  the covariance matrix and prove their ratio consistency. To facilitate fast computation,
  we further develop recursive algorithms to improve the computational efficiency
  of the monitoring procedure. The advantage of the proposed methodology is demonstrated
  via simulation studies and real data illustrations.
