abstract: In various manufacturing applications such as steel, composites, and textile
  production, anomaly detection in noisy images is of special importance. Although
  there are several methods for image denoising and anomaly detection, most of these
  perform denoising and detection sequentially, which affects detection accuracy and
  efficiency. Additionally, the low computational speed of some of these methods is
  a limitation for real-time inspection. In this article, we develop a novel methodology
  for anomaly detection in noisy images with smooth backgrounds. The proposed method,
  named smooth-sparse decomposition, exploits regularized high-dimensional regression
  to decompose an image and separate anomalous regions by solving a large-scale optimization
  problem. To enable the proposed method for real-time implementation, a fast algorithm
  for solving the optimization model is proposed. Using simulations and a case study,
  we evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with existing
  methods. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in
  terms of the detection accuracy as well as computation time. This article has supplementary
  materials that includes all the technical details, proofs, MATLAB codes, and simulated
  images used in the article.
