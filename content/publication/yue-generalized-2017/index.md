abstract: Process monitoring and quality control is essential for continuous manufacturing
  processes of carbon nano- tube (CNT) thin sheets or buckypaper. Raman spectroscopy
  is an attractive inline quality characterization and quantification tool for nanomanufacturing
  because of its nondestructive nature, fast data acquisition speed, and ability to
  provide detailed material information. However, there is signal-dependent noise
  buried in the Raman spectra, which reduces the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and affects
  the accuracy, efficiency, and sensitivity for Raman spectrum-based quality control
  approaches. In this paper, a signal analysis model with signal-dependent noise for
  Raman spectroscopy is developed and validated based on experimental data. The wavelet
  shrinkage method is used for denoising and improving the S/N ratio of raw Raman
  spectra. Based on the validated signal-noise relationship, a novel generalized wavelet
  shrinkage approach is introduced to remove noise in all wavelet coefficients by
  applying individual adaptive wavelet thresholds. The effectiveness of this method
  is demonstrated using both simulation and experimental case studies of inline Raman
  monitoring of continuous buckypaper manufacturing. The proposed method allows for
  a significant reduction of Raman data acquisition time without much loss of S/N
  ratio, which inherently enables Raman spectroscopy for inline monitoring and control
  for continuous nanomanufacturing processes.
