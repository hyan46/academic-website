abstract: Analysis of large-scale high-dimensional data with a complex heterogeneous
  data structure to extract information or useful features is vital for the purpose
  of data fusion for assessment of system performance, early detection of system anomalies,
  intelligent sampling and sensing for data collection and decision making to achieve
  optimal system performance. Chapter 3 focuses on detecting anomalies from high-dimensional
  data. Traditionally, most of the image-based anomaly detection methods perform denoising
  and detection sequentially, which affects detection accuracy and efficiency. In
  this chapter, A novel methodology, named smooth-sparse decomposition (SSD), is proposed
  to exploit regularized high-dimensional regression to decompose an image and separate
  anomalous regions simultaneously by solving a large-scale optimization problem.
  Chapter 4 extends this to spatial-temporal functional data by extending SSD to spatiotemporal
  smooth-sparse decomposition (ST-SSD), with a likelihood ratio test to detect the
  time of change accurately based on the detected anomaly. To enable real-time implementation
  of the proposed methodology, recursive estimation procedures for ST-SSD are also
  developed. The proposed methodology is also applied to tonnage signals, rolling
  inspection data and solar flare monitoring. Chapter 5 considers the adaptive sampling
  problem for high-dimensional data. A novel adaptive sampling framework, named Adaptive
  Kernelized Maximum-Minimum Distance is proposed to adaptively estimate the sparse
  anomalous region. The proposed method balances the sampling efforts between the
  space filling sampling (exploration) and focused sampling near the anomalous region
  (exploitation). The proposed methodology is also applied to a case study of anomaly
  detection in composite sheets using a guided wave test. Chapter 6 explores the penalized
  tensor regression to model the tensor response data with the process variables.
  Regularized Tucker decomposition and regularized tensor regression methods are developed,
  which model the structured point cloud data as tensors and link the point cloud
  data with the process variables. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated
  through simulation and a real case study of turning process optimization.
