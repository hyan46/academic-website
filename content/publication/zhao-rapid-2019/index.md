abstract: 'In many bio-surveillance and healthcare applications, data sources are
  measured from many spatial locations repeatedly over time, say, daily/weekly/monthly.
  In these applications, we are typically interested in detecting hot-spots, which
  are defined as some structured outliers that are sparse over the spatial domain
  but persistent over time. In this paper, we propose a tensor decomposition method
  to detect when and where the hot-spots occur. Our proposed methods represent the
  observed raw data as a three-dimensional tensor including a circular time dimension
  for daily/weekly/monthly patterns, and then decompose the tensor into three components:
  smooth global trend, local hot-spots, and residuals. A combination of LASSO and
  fused LASSO is used to estimate the model parameters, and a CUSUM procedure is applied
  to detect when and where the hot-spots might occur. The usefulness of our proposed
  methodology is validated through numerical simulation and a real-world dataset in
  the weekly number of gonorrhea cases from $2006$ to $2018$ for $50$ states in the
  United States.'
